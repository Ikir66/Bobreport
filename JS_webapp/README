Bobreport is a web application for reporting and summarizing daily behaviour


1. CONFIG
  Configurations for database client are located in the "/config/config.js".


2. RUNNING LOCALLY
  Running is done in "app.js". Command for running the app can be found last in
  that file.


3. DESIGN NOTES
  Username is used instead of email for registering users since I wanted to make
  the app less formal. I also took some other freedoms in design, for example my UI
  for reporting and summarization pages are a little different from asked but in my
  opinion pretty well working and not "wrong" in that sense. The summarization
  page lets the user choose wanted time period from calendar instead of choosing
  specific week or month.
  The database is divided into different tables for mornings, evenings, and moods :D
  which maybe isn't optimal but still works.
  Summary page shows data for last 7 days and 30 days NOT including current day.
  Reports cannot be done for days that already have the specific report type done.
  E.g. if a user tries to do two morning reports for the current day the second one
  is discarded, and the first one cannot be removed, which is maybe a bit stupid
  design.

6. CREATE TABLE STATEMENTS FOR DATABASE



CREATE TABLE users1 (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(320) NOT NULL,
  password CHAR(60) NOT NULL
);



CREATE TABLE morning_reports (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sleep_duration NUMERIC(4,2),
    sleep_quality INTEGER,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users1(id),
    date DATE
);
Example: INSERT INTO morning_reports (sleep_duration, sleep_quality, mood, user_id, date) VALUES (8.25, 3, 4, 1, NOW());



CREATE TABLE evening_reports (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    time_sports NUMERIC(4,2),
    time_studied NUMERIC(4,2),
    eating INTEGER,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users1(id),
    date DATE
);
Example: INSERT INTO evening_reports (time_sports, time_studied, eating, mood, user_id, date) VALUES (3.5, 5.75, 3, 5, 1, NOW());



CREATE TABLE moods (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    mood INTEGER,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users1(id),
    date DATE
);
Example: INSERT INTO moods (mood, user_id, date) VALUES (1, 2,  NOW());
